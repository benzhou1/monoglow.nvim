## üì¶ Installation

Install the theme with your preferred package manager, such as
[folke/lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "wnkz/monoglow.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  opts = {},
}
```

## üöÄ Usage

```lua
vim.cmd[[colorscheme monoglow]]
```

```vim
colorscheme monoglow

" There are also colorschemes for the different styles.
colorscheme monoglow-z
colorscheme monoglow-lack
colorscheme monoglow-void
```

## ü™ì Overriding Colors & Highlight Groups

How the highlight groups are calculated:

1. `colors` are determined based on your configuration, with the ability to
   override them using `config.on_colors(colors)`.
1. These `colors` are utilized to generate the highlight groups.
1. `config.on_highlights(highlights, colors)` can be used to override highlight
   groups.

For default values of `colors` and `highlights`, please consult the
[z](extras/lua/monoglow_z.lua),
[lack](extras/lua/monoglow_moon.lua), and
[void](extras/lua/monoglow_night.lua) themes.

## About

To build the colorscheme, I took everthing I liked about the "colors" of [slugbyte/lackluster.nvim](https://github.com/slugbyte/lackluster.nvim),
I added the amazing touch of glow and bright operators from [Aliqyan-21/darkvoid.nvim](https://github.com/Aliqyan-21/darkvoid.nvim),
and I used [folke/tokyonight.nvim](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) for the code structure.
