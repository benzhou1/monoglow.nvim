## About

To build the colorscheme, I took everthing I liked about the "colors" of [slugbyte/lackluster.nvim](https://github.com/slugbyte/lackluster.nvim),
I added the amazing touch of glow and bright operators from [Aliqyan-21/darkvoid.nvim](https://github.com/Aliqyan-21/darkvoid.nvim),
and I used [folke/tokyonight.nvim](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) for the code structure.
